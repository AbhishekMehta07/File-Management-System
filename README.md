File Management System
======================

Overview
--------
The **File Management System** is a C++ program designed to handle files securely by implementing **encryption and decryption**. It ensures that sensitive data remains protected by encoding it before storage and allowing authorized users to decode it when needed. 

This project is useful for **personal security**, **data protection**, and **confidential file management**.

Features
--------
- **File Encryption**: Convert plaintext files into encrypted formats to prevent unauthorized access.
- **File Decryption**: Restore encrypted files to their original readable form.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and efficient console-based system.
- **Fast Processing**: Uses optimized algorithms for quick encryption and decryption.
- **Platform Independent**: Can be compiled and executed on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

Installation
------------
### Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have **g++ (GCC Compiler)** installed.
- Alternatively, install **MinGW** for Windows or use a standard **Linux/Mac compiler**.

### Steps to Compile and Run:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AbhishekMehta07/File-Management-System.git
   cd File-Management-System
   ```

2. **Compile the program**:
   ```
   g++ crypt.cpp -o file_manager
   ```

3. **Run the program**:
   ```
   ./file_manager
   ```

Usage
-----
1. **Start the program** using the command above.
2. **Follow the on-screen options** to encrypt or decrypt a file.
3. **Provide the file path** and encryption key (if required).
4. **The system processes the file** and outputs the encrypted/decrypted content.

Technologies Used
-----------------
- **C++** for core development
- **File Handling** to read and write encrypted/decrypted data
- **Bitwise Operations** for encryption logic

Future Improvements
-------------------
- Add **GUI support** for a more interactive user experience.
- Implement **AES or RSA encryption** for stronger security.
- Enable **batch processing** for encrypting multiple files simultaneously.
- Create **user authentication** to enhance file security.
